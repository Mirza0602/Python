For each of these sequences the *minimum-, maximum-, mean- and median-value* shall be calculated. These 4 statistics shall be stored in a vector. All 4-element-statistics-vectors shall be stored in a vector of length 10. Implement this task in 2 variations. First, the statistics shall be calculated within a for-loop. Then a function for calculating the statistics of a single sequence shall be implemented. This function shall then be applied within a `lapply()`-function. The `lapply()`-call shall return the length-10 vector, which contains the statistics of all 10 random sequences. \n"
