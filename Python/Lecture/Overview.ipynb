    "> This Python course is the first part of the lecture [Programming Languages for Data Scientists](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/ds/de/weiterbildung/modul_07/) within the master program [Data Science and Business Analytics](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/ds/de/masterstudium) at HdM Stuttgart. In the second part of this lecture the programming language *R* is introduced. Both programming languages are introduced in a quite general manner. However, in the selection of routines, packages and examples Data Science tasks are focused. The concrete implementation of typical Data-Science-/Data-Mining-processes is not subject of this course but of the follow-up lecture [Data Mining Process](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/ds/de/weiterbildung/modul_12).  \n",

    "## Getting started with Python\n",
    "In [Getting started with Python](01GettingStarted.ipynb) you will learn about the main features of Python, in particular the ones, which make it a number-one tool for all kinds of data science tasks. Moreover, the most important Python distributions and packages for data scientists and some popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are sketched.\n",

    "Basic routines in the daily work with Python are summarized in notebook [Basic Routines](02BasicRoutines.ipynb). You will learn how to download and install packages, how to get help and how to import/export data into/from Python scripts."

For more complex tasks implementation in single scripts can be inefficient and error-prone. In order to provide readability, maintainability, reusability and reliability, complex software is usually structured in modules and functions. Notebook [Modules and Functions](05Functions.ipynb) first introduces the notions of *packages*, *modules* and *functions* in Python. Then the definition and application of functions in Python is described.   "

    "## Object Oriented Programming in Python\n",
    "Splitting code in smaller reusable and manageable functions, as introduced in the previous section, is one way to realize modularity. Another, more elaborated and more comprehensive approach is object oriented programing (OOP). An object oriented software design consists of objects that interact with one another. Notebook [Object Oriented Programming](06ObjectOrientedProgramming.ipynb) demonstrates the key OOP concepts in Python, the definition of classes and the instantiation of objects. Classes can be considered as blueprints and objects are concrete instances of these blueprints. "
