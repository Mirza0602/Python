    "In the [lecture on functions](#05Functions) the motivation for a **modular software design** has already been described: A modular design increases readability, reliability, maintainability and thus the general quality of the software. Splitting code in smaller reusable and manageable functions is one way to realize modularity. An other, more elaborated and more comprehensive approach is **object oriented programing (OOP)**. An object oriented software design consists of *objects* that interact with one another. Actually, objects are not defined itself, but *classes*. **A class can be considered as a blueprint and objects are concrete instances of these blueprints**. An arbitrary number of objects of a given class can exist in the program. Objects have\n",
    "* a **type**: this is the class from which they are instantiated\n",
    "* **data**, which is stored in the objects **attributes**\n",
    "* **functions**: These functions, defined inside classes, are called **methods**. They can access and/or modify the attributes of the same object and of **associated objects** .\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually in Python all datatypes are objects. For example strings have a certain definition for the class `string`, this defintion contains attributes (the data, which is stored in a string-variable) and functions, that operate on this data. In the first line of the following code-cell an object of class `string` is instantiated. In the second line a method, defined for this class is called and the third line provides the class-name, of the object, refered by `myString`."

    "1. **Instance Attributes** (or: Object Variables) are variables which can have different values for all objects of a class. For example a class `Person` may have the instance attribute `age`. Each object of this class (modell of a concrete person) has it's own age-value. Object variables are owned by each individual object, i.e. each object has its own copy of the variable.\n",
    "2. **Class Attribures** are shared by all objects (instances) of a given class. They can be accessed and changed by any object of the class. If one object modifies the value of a class attribute, all other objects of the same class see the same modified value. For example `person_count` may be a class-attribute of the class `Person`. If this attribute is incremented whenever a new person object is instantiated, all person objects know how much persons currently exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually there exists many instance attributes but no, or only a few class attributes. Instance attributes are defined within the `__init__()`-method (=*constuctor* of the class; see below) of the class. The name of each instance attribute must be preceded by `self.` Class attributes are defined at the top of the class-definition body.  "

Whenever, classes are related in this way it is inefficient to implement them independently, as in the example above. It is much more efficient to exploit the concept of inheritance in such cases. This concept allows to define in the more specific class only the attributes and methods, in which it differs from the more general class. All attributes and methods, which are contained in both classes must only be defined in the general class. The more general class, from which the more specific class inherits is called the **super-class**, and the more specific class is called the **sub-class**.\n",
