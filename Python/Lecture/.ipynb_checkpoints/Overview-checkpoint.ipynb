    "Goal of this workshop is to demonstrate how *Python* and it's main Machine Learning Framework [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) can be applied for data mining, in particular for learning, testing and evaluating models. *Scikit-Learn* is based on [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), which is the fundamental package for scientific calculation in Python. Comfortable methods for data access and data analysis are provided by [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). Pandas is also based on *Numpy*. The main library for 2- and 3-dimensional data visualisation is [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). Numpy datastructures can easily be visualized with matplotlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "Selected concepts, classes and methods of *Scikit-Learn* are demonstrated in the main part [Data Mining with Python Modules](#data_mining) of this workshop. Basic concepts of the mentioned base- and helper-modules *Numpy, Pandas* and *Matplotlib* can be learned from the jupyter notebooks of chapter [Basic Modules](#basic_modules)."

    "The main Python modules, which are usually applied in the context of scikit-learn are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Basics in Numpy (.ipynb)](NP01numpyBasics.ipynb) / [[.html]](NP01numpyBasics.html)\n",
    "* [Basics in Matplotlib (.ipynb)](PLT01visualization.ipynb) / [[.html]](PLT01visualization.html)\n",
    "* [Basics in Pandas (.ipynb)](PD01Pandas.ipynb) / [[.html]](PD01Pandas.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concepts of the Python Machine Learning framework [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) are:\n",
    "* it is primarily built on Numpy. In particular internal and external data structures are [Numpy Arrays](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html).\n",
    "* All algorithms, which somehow transform data belong to the **<span class=\"mark\">Transformer</span>**-class, e.g. *PCA, Normalizer, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder*, etc. These transformers are trained by applying the *<span class=\"mark\">.fit(traindata)</span>*-method. Once they are trained, there *<span class=\"mark\">.transform(data)</span>*-method can be called in order to transform *data*. If the data used for training the transformer shall be transformed immediately after training, the *.<span class=\"mark\">fit_transform(data)</span>*-method can be applied.\n",
    "* All Machine Learning algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning belong to the **<span class=\"mark\">Estimator</span>** class, e.g. *LogisticRegression, SVM, MLP, Kmeans*, etc. These estimators are trained by applying the *.fit(trainfeatures)*- or *<span class=\"mark\">.fit(trainfeatures,trainlabels)</span>*-method. The former configuration is applied for unsupervised-, the latter for supervised learning. Once an estimator is trained, it can be applied for clustering, classification or regression by envoking the *.<span class=\"mark\">predict(data)</span>*-method. \n",
    "* At their interfaces all **Transformers** and **Estimators** apply *Numpy Arrays*."
