    "## Python for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists a bunch of commercial tools, which provide functions for solving routine data science tasks. One of the main drawbacks of these tools, is that they limit analysis to their limited set of available functions. Data science does not require only standard routines. Instead each task and each dataset has its own characteristics and requirements. Hence, in order to obtain a maximum of knowledge from the given data individual functions must be implemented. This is either impossible or expensive with proprietary tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, there exists programming languages and -environments, which are freely available for all platforms. Data Scientists, who are familiar with the basic programming skills in these frameworks, are capable to implement individual solutions for individual problems. Their solution is not bound to the limits given by the applied software tool. Their solution can provide maximum knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all programming environments are equally well suited for efficient data analysis. The following properties of Python are particularly important for data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The programming language is easy to learn and intuitive to apply.\n",
    "* Efficient Data science requires a certain degree of interactivity. An interactive interpreter allows to interact with each line of code and to develop analysis code step-by-step.\n",
    "* Efficient datastructures are provided. E.g. for fast storage, sorting and filtering of large datasets.\n",
    "* Data science integrates methods from statistical modelling, linear algebra, data storage and retrieval, machine learning, visualization, business intelligence, natural language processing and more. Comprehensive libraries of functions from these disciplines are available for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other characteristics of Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* for an interpreted language it is efficient in terms of computing complexity and storage. \n",
    "* it is easily extensible\n",
    "* it provides efficient tools for debugging\n",
    "* it is cross-platform cabable, i.e. the programs run on Windows, MAC and Linux without requiring platform-specific adaptations.\n",
    "* it is supported by a large community\n",
    "* it is an object-oriented programming language, but it also supports other programming paradigms such as procedural programming and functional programming.\n",
    " \n",
    "Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs. The main reasons for this are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;\n",
    "* no variable or argument declarations are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "And solving a task with fewer lines of codes implies that the code is more robust and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will experience in this course, that in Python it is easy to implement even quite complex analysis tasks in only few lines of codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "More general characteristics of Python can be found e.g. in the [Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/index.html), in particular in it's first chapter [Whetting Your Appetite](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/appetite.html). A summary of Python's main features is also given in [6 Reasons Why Python is Suddenly Super Popular](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/07/6-reasons-python-suddenly-super-popular.html). The stackoverflow post [The Incredible Growth of Python](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/) shows that Python is currently the most growing programming language. Reasons for this overwhelming growth are elaborated in the post [Why is Python Growing so Quickly?](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/).\n"

    "## Important Python Libraries for Data Science\n",
    "Goal of this workshop is to demonstrate how *Python* and it's main Machine Learning Framework [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) can be applied for data mining, in particular for learning, testing and evaluating models. *Scikit-Learn* is based on [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), which is the fundamental package for scientific calculation in Python. Comfortable methods for data access and data analysis are provided by [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). Pandas is also based on *Numpy*. The main library for 2- and 3-dimensional data visualisation is [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). Numpy datastructures can easily be visualized with matplotlib.\n",
