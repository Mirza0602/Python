E.g. in the [example of a simple for-loop](#simplefor) for each integer $i$ in `range(10)` a tuple consisting of $i$, $i^2$ and $i^3$ is calculated. Each of this tuples is stored in a list. This list can be considered to be the output for the given input `range(10)`. One can say that the loop **maps** each input-element to an output-element. Tasks of this type can be solved more efficiently by **list-comprehensions** and the `map()`-function."
