    "1. Read data from [lobbyPediaParteispenden.csv](lobbyPediaParteispenden.csv) into Pandas dataframe. This file is a dump of the [Lobbypedia Database](https://lobbypedia.de/wiki/Hauptseite), which contains all donations of more than 10000.- Euros to German political parties. Hint: Set the argument `encoding=\"latin-1\"` in the `read_csv()`-method.\n",
    "2. Remove the columns `Bundesland`, `Branche`, `Kategorie` and `Schlagworte`, since these columns contain no relevant data. Determine the number of rows and columns in the resulting dataframe and display it's head.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Transform the values in column `Betrag` into a numeric representation. This can be done by removing all characters behind the `,` (i.e. decimal places and the Euro-Sign are cut) and converting the type of this pruned string into an integer-type. Hint: Implement this transformation in a function, which is then passed to the `apply()`-function of the pandas dataframe. "
