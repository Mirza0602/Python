    "## Task:\n",
    "In this task data, which has been recorded by a Polar sport watch during a long-distance run, shall be visualized. The data is available in a json file. The python package `json` and it's method `load()` can be applied to read data from a .json-File into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "1. Load the contents of file `polarV800.json` into a dictionary\n",
    "2. Determine the keys of this dictionary and display the values of some keys\n",
    "3. The value of the key `samples` is a dictionary itself. This dictionary has the following key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. key \"0\": value is a list of heartrate-values, sampled every second during a training measurement\n",
    "    2. key \"1\": value is a list of the speed-values, sampled every second during a training measurement\n",
    "    3. key \"2\": value is a list of the cadence-values, sampled every second during a training measurement\n",
    "    4. key \"3\": value is a list of the altitude-values, sampled every second during a training measurement\n",
    "    5. key \"10\": value is a list of distance-values, sampled every second during a training measurement\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Write these 5 sequences into the columns of a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Visualize these 5 sequences by applying Bokeh. The different plots shall be linked. The plots shall contain interactive elements. Moreover, the heart-rate time-series shall be backgrounded by different colors for each of the heart-rate zones. The lower and upper limits ot the 5 different heart-rate-zones can be obtained from the key `heart-rate-zones`. "
